# MyBot — Next Steps

## What's Working
<!-- Updated each session — 2026-05-11 -->
- On-call watchdog (`oncall-watchdog.js`) running every 2min with 6 deterministic health checks:
  1. CLI auth health (escalates after 3 failures, 30min cooldown)
  2. Sandbox credential freshness (auto-refreshes if >5min stale)
  3. Process leak detection (kills orphan claude processes >10, escalates node >20)
  4. Disk space monitoring (/tmp sweep at 80%, escalate /app/data at 90%)
  5. Event loop lag (graceful restart after 3 consecutive >30s readings)
  6. Semaphore leak detection (clears stuck busy channels with dead processes)
- `/health/watchdog` endpoint returns rolling health report (last 10 cycles)
- `/health` endpoint now uses watchdog's cached CLI result (no redundant spawns)
- Sandbox auth hardening: 3-layer defense (per-spawn refresh + 60s periodic + auth-failure retry)
- All sandbox users (Merrisa, Daniel, Lee) have fresh creds and are ready
- Missed-message recovery: on restart, detects webhook gaps >90s via persisted timestamp (`/app/data/watchdog-state.json`), proactively messages recently active chats to resend. Guards against null adapter, double-notify with auto-resume, and logs write failures.
- Owner DM now uses `claude-opus-4-6` (200k context) with high effort (was `claude-opus-4-7`)
- `!reinit` command and `/reinit` skill wired up (command-utils.js, reinit-prompt.js, commands/reinit.js)
- Queue runner now passes a proper ChannelProxy to `runClaudeWithContinuation` for progress messages
- `isCommandLike()` utility replaces raw `text.startsWith('!')` checks (supports `/` prefix too)
- Google auth token reconciliation now cross-references UUID↔phone map for accurate token lookup
- Concert price scraper now deterministic: `auto-context.js` detects ticket/price intent, extracts artist names, pre-fetches from scraper, injects `<concert-price-data>` into prompt — no tag emission needed from Claude
- **OAuth token auto-refresh**: `token-refresh.js` now does real OAuth2 refresh via `https://api.anthropic.com/token` using the refresh_token, syncs from Windows credentials mount — bot never loses auth even overnight
- **Signal user token cross-referencing**: `getTokenForSignalUser()` in `user-tokens.js` tries phone→UUID and UUID→phone via the UUID map, fixing Merrisa's calendar connection and all Signal user Google integrations
- **`/calendar/freebusy` endpoint**: New internal API for checking multi-user availability in one call
- **`!plan` command enhanced**: Accepts event poster images or text, runs 7-step research pipeline (venue, seating, interior photo, ticket prices via concert scraper, calendar check for all group members, parking/transport), stores result server-side for deterministic follow-ups
- **WSL stability**: `.wslconfig` has `autoMemoryReclaim=gradual`, WSL vhdx compacted (141GB→56GB), Windows credentials mounted read-only into container

## What's Broken / In Progress
<!-- Active issues, blockers, half-done work -->
- `!plan` venue interior photos: downloads work but image attachment delivery to Signal is inconsistent — may need to verify the `/tmp/` path extraction regex catches the downloaded file
- `!plan` in group chats: bot requires @mention even for `!plan` command — should auto-respond to `!` commands without mention

## Next Steps
- Test `!plan` with image attachment in group chat — verify venue photo, seating info, and concert scraper integration all fire
- Verify follow-up messages after `!plan` (e.g. "send me a link") correctly reference the last-planned event via `state._lastPlan`
- Test OAuth token auto-refresh by waiting for token expiry window and checking logs for `[token-refresh] OAuth token refreshed`
- Monitor watchdog logs for any degraded checks: `docker compose logs claude-api | grep oncall-watchdog`
